### SQL REST SERVER

In Many Situation, you found your self need a very simple web REST services server, to be used to interface a database server (Ex: SQL Server , MySql..etc), for example You making a simple survey form and you need to collect all data in a DB server.

All what you need to create a DB contain a table consist of columns (their names are the same like the one used in the HTML form input textbox) and make the form submit using the REST POST using SqlRestServer URL and it will automatic create the insert query and insert them to your database.

I Searched the internet to found a simple REST server which can be used as SQL Rest Server and I found a really simple one called **Jacwright RESTServer v1.0.1**, thanks :)
It is a PHP REST server for providing a very light-weight REST API. Very easy to set up and get going. Independent from other libraries and frameworks. 

_There are alot of TODO tasks need to be done in the future, like suppoing MYSQL or others DB , handling error , more secure server , handling diffrenet naming mapping between the HTML form and the DB ...etc_

_Enjoy My SQL REST Server_
